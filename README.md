# Definitely Not Minecraft
This was Anish and my Grade 12 ICS summative, built off of my custom 3D rendering engine for Grade 11 ICS.

## Building
To build, you will need JOCL to run the rendering. If I ever get time, I'll re-implement CPU rendering and make it so you can switch between both. For now, if it crashes, or you don't know how to get modules, well, unfortunate.

## Running
To run, simply download the [zip](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/shndepimm1sr35by5r58r/Craft_Me_In.zip?rlkey=k7wll57rhryallhsubf9mh9dj&st=qdm3ps3m&dl=0) and run the Craft_Me_In.JAR file.

## Features of Craft Me In
- Infinite and procedural chunk generation
- Algorithm to only draw a mesh around surfaces that are between a block and air within a chunk
- Optimized regeneration of meshes to allow for loading in and out of chunks based on player location
- Realistic physics for movement and collisions
- Multiple blocks built into the chunk class
- Ability to place and destroy blocks
- Ability to save and clear the world, including all player made alterations

## Features of Real-Engine
- No UV Mapping, rather, the engine draws points from the surface of each mesh to the camera
- Complete Point3D, Quaternion, and Vector classes
- Eye-like projection
- Realistic rotation and movement of the camera
- Custon Mesh generation
